Performance measurements (Old)
========================

The system to perform these benchmarks is no longer available, for the newer benchmarking
setup see :doc:`../performance`. However, the results and the details of the old benchmarking 
system are preserved below.

You can view the performance plots for:

Build measurements
------------------

For measuring the build time, the following commands are executed from the trunk directory of the mCRL2 repository::

  make distclean
  svn update
  ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
  make bjam
  time make
  make install
  
Here, ``PREFIX`` is the path to the installation directory.
No options other than ``--prefix`` are passed to ``./configure`` and compiler
caches (like ccache) are not used. Only the time needed for the make command is
measured.

Tool measurements
-----------------

The following tools are currently being measured:

  =========  =======
  Tool	     Options
  =========  =======
  mcrl22lps	 ``[default]``, ``-fD``, ``-nfD``
  lps2lts	   ``[default]``, ``-rjittyc``
  pbes2bool	 ``-pquantifier-all``, ``-pquantifier-all -rjittyc``
  =========  =======
  
The benchmark set consists of 14 mCRL2 specifications.

Every tool + options combination is run on every input specification (say input.mcrl2) in the following way:

* :ref:`tool-mcrl22lps` is run on :file:`input.mcrl2`
* For :ref:`tool-lps2lts` an LPS is generated with the following command::

    mcrl22lps -fD input.mcrl2 | lpsconstelm | lpsparelm | lpssuminst > input.lps
  
  The tool is then run on :file:`input.lps`.
* For :ref:`tool-pbes2bool` a PBES is generated by running the following command
  on the LPS that was generated for lps2lts above, and the μ-calculus formula for
  absence of deadlock::
  
    lps2pbes -f no_deadlock.mcf input.lps | pbesrewr > input.pbes
    
  The tool is then run on :file:`input.pbes`.
  
Of every run, both time and memory usage are measured. If the run fails or runs
out of memory, a value of ``-1`` is registered.

Notes
^^^^^

* The measurements are performed nightly but only if the SVN source tree has
  changed since the previous measurements.
* For some tool + options combinations and case studies measurements have
  started more recently than for others. Also, memory measurements have first
  been performed in SVN revision 4360.
* Up to revision 5964 (14 April 2009), :ref:`tool-pbes2bool` was run with the
  option ``-p`` instead of ``-pquantifier-all``. Note that these options are not  
  comparable.
