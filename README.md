mCRL2 is a formal specification language with an associated toolset. The toolset
can be used for modelling, validation and verification of concurrent systems and
protocols. It can be run on Windows, Linux and macOS.

The toolset supports a collection of tools for linearisation, simulation,
state-space exploration and generation and tools to optimise and analyse
specifications. Moreover, state spaces can be manipulated, visualised and
analysed.

The mCRL2 toolset is developed at the department of Mathematics and Computer
Science of the [Technische Universiteit Eindhoven](https://fsa.win.tue.nl/), in
collaboration with the [University of Twente](http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl).

See our [website](https://mcrl2.org) for extensive documentation on the usage of
the toolset and downloads of the release and nightly versions.

## Build instructions
mCRL2 has the following dependencies:
 - Qt (5.5.0 or higher, only for the GUI tools)
 - Boost (1.48 or higher)

Furthermore, sphinx and xsltproc are required to build the documentation.
Makefiles can be generated using cmake. To build the toolset in Release mode
using 4 threads, run the following commands (preferably in an empty directory):

```
git clone https://github.com/mCRL2org/mCRL2 src
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
make -j4
```

When compilation is finished, the binaries can be found in `stage/bin/`.
Convenient front-ends for cmake are ccmake (macOS/Linux) and cmake-gui. Under
Windows and macOS, it is usually necessary to set the variables
`Boost_INCLUDE_DIR` and `Qt5_DIR` manually. More build instructions can be found
in the
[documentation](https://mcrl2.org/web/user_manual/build_instructions/index.html).

## Contributing
